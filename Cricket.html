The inception of the Cricket Academy at Ananthapuram Sports Village (ASV) in 2004 marked a transformative moment in the landscape of cricketing talent development. Originally tailored for day-scholars, the academy underwent a pivotal evolution in 2010 with the introduction of a residential program. This paradigm shift aimed to harness the potential of highly talented and motivated athletes, propelling them towards success at advanced levels of cricketing competition.
<br>
<br>
The selection process for these exceptional athletes is meticulously orchestrated through a structured Talent Identification (Talent ID) program developed by Rural Development Trust (RDT). Drawing participants from various RDT Cricket coaching centers at the grassroots level, this Talent ID program serves as a crucible for identifying and nurturing emerging cricketing talent. The objective is clear: to spot individuals with not only innate skill but also an unwavering determination to excel in the sport.

As of today, ASV's Cricket Academy stands as a beacon of cricketing excellence, supporting a total of 70 boys competing across Under-14, Under-16, and Under-19 age groups. These aspiring cricketers undergo a holistic developmental journey, where their skills are honed, and their character is molded under the guidance of four dedicated full-time coaches. The coaching team's commitment extends beyond the technical aspects of the game, fostering values of discipline, teamwork, and resilience.
<br>
<br>
Beyond the realms of developmental training, ASV has become a pivotal hub for competitive cricket. The academy hosts prestigious tournaments, including matches affiliated with the Assam Cricket Association (ACA) inter-zone competitions and the revered Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Ranji Trophy. These platforms provide the academy's cricketers with exposure to high-stakes competitions, enabling them to test their mettle against formidable opponents.

Adding a grassroots flavor to the cricketing fervor, the Ananthapuram Premier League (APL) has emerged as a vibrant cricket league. Active for nearly half the year with weekend matches, APL not only adds a layer of community engagement but also serves as a crucible for discovering local talents who might shape the future of cricket in the region.
