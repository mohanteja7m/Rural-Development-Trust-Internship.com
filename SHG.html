                The idea of facilitating these groups and federations is to mobilise them through awareness workshops and training in capacity-building. Eventually, in 1989, RDT decided to continue this as an independent sector for PWDs. The SHG and federation programme that started with just 20 villages had grown to 70 by 1991. Today, RDT works in over 2586 villages in Ananthapuram and parts of Kurnool district. Operated at village, block and district levels, the groups are called SHGs at the village level, and Federations at the block and district level. All these groups are categorised as Disabled People's Organisations (DPOs), made up of people with different disabilities and/or their care-givers, in the cases where the PWD cannot represent herself or himself due to the severity of their disability.

                District-level federations further the cause of inclusion through emphasis on resource mobilisation, accessibility, protection of rights and privileges and tackling violence and discrimination.
